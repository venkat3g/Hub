# Hub
Launcher for websites and local programs

# Installing
Have java-jdk installed in order to compile the files yourself.

# Already Installed / Downloaded jar
Create a new folder for the 'Hub' as having multiple 'Hubs' in the same folder will not work. 
Next, launch the Hub. Create a shortcut to your desktop if you would like. (For the jar)
Go ahead and add websites and programs to your Hub.

# Adding Images to each button
By default each program you add will take a copy of the image and save it into the (Hub folder)/Images folder.
If you would like to add your own images, right click the button that you will like to customize. 
From here select any Image you like.
However try to keep the file size of the images low as it will lead to longer load times of Hub.
Currently Hub accepts jpg, png.

# Note
Most programs will be added not all, have currently exe, and lnk types tested.
